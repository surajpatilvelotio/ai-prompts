## Contributing Domain-Specific Prompts

When contributing a domain-specific prompt, consider the following:

1. Place it in the appropriate domain folder
2. If your prompt applies to multiple domains, choose the most relevant one
3. If a suitable domain doesn't exist, suggest creating a new domain folder
4. Make sure your prompt addresses a specific workflow or task relevant to practitioners in that domain
