## Contributing Use Case Prompts

When contributing a use case prompt, consider the following:

1. Place it in the appropriate use case folder
2. If your prompt applies to multiple use cases, choose the most relevant one
3. If a suitable use case folder doesn't exist, suggest creating a new one
4. Make sure your prompt is generalized enough to be useful across different domains and technologies
5. Include examples that demonstrate how the prompt can be adapted to different contexts
