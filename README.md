# Prompt Library Website

This directory contains the GitHub Pages website for browsing and searching prompts in the repository. The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Features

- Dark-themed UI optimized for readability
- Search functionality to find prompts by keyword
- Filtering by prompt type, section, and tags
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Modal popups for viewing full prompt details
- Copy button for easily copying prompts to clipboard

## Development

### Local Setup

To run the site locally:

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```
   cd site
   ```

2. If you want to generate the prompt index:
   ```
   npm init -y
   npm install glob
   node generate-index.js
   ```

3. Serve the directory with any static file server:
   ```
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve
   ```

4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever port your server uses)

### Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with the site layout
- `generate-index.js` - Script to generate an index of all prompts in the repository
- `assets/css/style.css` - Styling for the site
- `assets/js/main.js` - JavaScript for search, filtering, and displaying prompts
- `assets/js/prompt-index.json` - Generated index of all prompts (created by `generate-index.js`)

### Automatic Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml` automatically:

1. Generates the prompt index whenever new prompts are added
2. Deploys the site to the `gh-pages` branch
3. Makes it available at `https://<username>.github.io/ai-prompts/`

## Customization

To customize the site appearance or functionality:

- Edit `style.css` to change colors, layout, and styling
- Modify `main.js` to change search behavior or add new features
- Update `index.html` to adjust the page structure or add new UI elements

## Troubleshooting

- If prompts aren't loading, check the browser's console for error messages
- Make sure the index has been generated by running `node generate-index.js`
- Verify that prompt files follow the required format with Description and Prompt sections
